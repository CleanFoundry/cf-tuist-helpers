# `cf-tuist-helpers`

`cf-tuist-helpers` is a [project description helper Tuist plugin](https://docs.tuist.io/guides/develop/projects/plugins#project-description-helper-plugin) used in other CleanFoundry projects. Its purpose is to extend the Tuist layer of multiple CleanFoundry projects with organization-specific standards - like common dependencies, preferred directory structure, common launch arguments and environment variables. 

This repo does not intend to support non-CleanFoundry projects, so contribution is locked down, but it is made open-source in order to be used in other open source projects. GitHub Discussions are left open for any questions or comments.
